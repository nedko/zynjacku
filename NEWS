= Version 6 on 2011-03-27 =
 * Fixes and improvements that improve interoperability with these
   plugins:
    * The Composite Sampler
    * EQ10Q
    * Calf
 * Support the new dynamic manifest extension and thus NASPRO 0.2.90
 * It is now possible to supply on commandline a regular expression
   instead of URI. The regexp must match only one URI.
 * Plugin GUI windows now have WM_WINDOW_ROLE set to "plugin_ui" (for
   WM kludges etc)
 * Various improvements in lv2 turtle rdf parsing
 * A commandline parsing bug that prevented use of state file is fixed
 * Better reporting and handling of ttl syntax errors
 * The plugin scanner got some speed an memory optimizations
 * It is now possible to build and use zynjacku on MacOSX
 * Windows of the generic GUIs are now smaller when the plugin is not
   dynparam one
 * The Author column is now named Maintainer to better match
   doap:maintainer semantics
 * Change installation layout to better suit Debian and hopefully
   other distros as well
 * In single plugin mode, exit if UI show failed
 * Properly handle scan when there are no lv2 plugins installed (patch
   by Orcan Ogetbil)
   https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=551480
 * Fix syntax error exception. #15558
 * When rack was being cleared, some plugin UI windows were not being
   closed. This bug was fixed.

= Version 5 on 2009-06-13 =
 * slv2 is no longer required
 * cache list of suitable plugins
 * speedup plugin list window
 * new tool, zynspect, that can be used to list and inspect available
   lv2 plguins.
 * Fix assert when restoring rack presets
 * By default, sort plugins by name
 * Experimental support for dynmanifest extension. Combined with
   NASPRO allows loading ladspa plugins in lv2rack.
 * Set plugin GUI window's role to "plugin_ui" (for WM kludges etc)
 * single plugin mode for lv2rack
 * Hide external UIs when zynjacku/lv2rack quits

= Version 4 on 2009-01-28 =
 * lv2rack does no longer require PHAT (it was not really using it even
   in zynjacku-3 release)
 * Support for out of process plugin UIs (the upcomming nekobee release
   should use it)
 * Don't crash when trying to load non-existing plugin (specified by
   supplying plugin URI at commandline)
 * Don't crash with some plugins (NULL extension_data)

= Version 3 on 2009-01-21 =
 * Plugin presets (save/restore)
 * Support for Calf plugins (various extensions needed by development
   version)
 * MIDI CC/Pitchwheel automation. Not yet available for custom
   UIs. Works for float parameters only.
 * Replace PHAT fansliders with bundled knobs. PyPhat is no longer
   required.
 * lv2dynparam host library is now optional. To enable support for
   dynparam plugins (lv2zynadd) lv2dynparam1 version 2 is needed.

= Version 2 on 2008-11-30 =
 * zynjacku codebase updated to the latest state of LV2 art. Especially,
   event MIDI port synths are now supported.
 * The tarball now contains lv2rack - a host for LV2 effect plugins.
 * Saving/restoring of presets. Does not work for dynparam plugins yet.
 * LASH support (autodetected at runtime).
 * Lot of general fixes that should make zynjacku more usable.

 * Initial release
