/*
 *  = Purpose=
 *
 *  The purpose of this extension is to allow plugin parameters appear
 *  and disappear as response of existing parameter changes (i.e. number
 *  of voices) or executing commands (i.e. "add new voice"). It also
 *  allows grouping of parameters and groups. Groups can be used for
 *  things like ADSR abstraction, i.e. group of 4 float parameters.
 *
 *  = Architectural overview =
 *
 *   Plugin notifies host for changes through callbacks. During
 *   initialization, plugin notifies host about initial groups,
 *   parameters and commands through same callbacks used for later
 *   notification. There are callbacks to notify host for group,
 *   parameter and command disappears.
 *
 *   Groups are containers of other groups, parameters and
 *   commands. Parameters and groups have URIs. Parameter URIs are
 *   used to describe type of parameter (i.e. boolean, integer,
 *   string, etc.). Parameters are as simple as possible. There is one
 *   predefined Group URI for "generic group" type, i.e. container
 *   that is just that - a container of other groups, parameters and
 *   commands. Other group types are just hints and ones that are
 *   unknown to host, can be looked as generic ones. Only generic
 *   groups can contain groups. Groups of other types can contain only
 *   parameters. There is always one, root group. Name of the root
 *   groop is expected to match name of the plugin.
 *
 *  Groups, parameters and commands, have "name" containing short
 *  human readble description of object purpose.
 *
 *  Parameter ports, are bidirectional. Parameters have values, and
 *  some of them (depending of type) - range. Data storage for
 *  current, min and max values is in plugin memory. Host gets
 *  pointers to that memory and accesses the data in type specific
 *  way.
 *
 *  When plugin decides to change parameter value or range (as
 *  response to command execution or other parameter value change), it
 *  notifies host through callback.
 *
 *  When host decides to change parameter value or execute command (as
 *  resoponse to user action, i.e. knob rotation/button press, or some
 *  kind of automation), it calls plugin callback. In case of
 *  parameter, it first changes the value in the plugin data storage
 *  for particular parameter. Host ensures that values being set are
 *  within current range (if range is defined for particular port
 *  type).
 *
 *  Apart from initialization (host_attach), plugin may call host
 *  callbacks only as response to command execution or parameter
 *  change notification (from host).
 *
 *  Host serializes calls to plugin dynparam callbacks and the
 *  run/connect_port lv2 callbacks. Thus plugin does not need to take
 *  special measures for thread safety.  in callbacks called by host.
 *
 *  Plugin can assume that host will never call dynamic parameter
 *  functions when lv2 plugin callbacks (like run and connect_port) are
 *  being called. I.e. calls are serialized, no need for locks in
 *  plugin. Plugin must not suspend execution (sleep/lock) while being
 *  called by host. If it needs to sleep to implement action requested
 *  by host, like allocation of data for new voice, the allocation
 *  should be done in background thread and when ready, transfered to
 *  the realtime code. During initialization (host_attach) plugin is
 *  allowed to sleep. Thus conventional memory allocation is allowed
 *  in host_attach.
 *
 *  = Intialization sequence =
 *
 *  1. Host discovers whether plugin supports the extension by
 *     inspecting the RDF Turtle file.
 *  2. Host calls lv2 extension_data callback, plugin returns pointer
 *     to struct lv2dynparam_plugin_callbacks containing pointers to
 *     several funtions, including host_attach.
 *  3. For each instantiated plugin supporting this extension, host
 *     calls host_attach function with parameters:
 *     - a LV2_Handle, plugin instance handle
 *     - pointer to struct lv2dynparam_host_callbacks, containing
 *       pointers to several functions, to be called by plugin.
 *     - instance host context, opaque pointer
 *  4. During initialization (host_attach), initial groups and
 *     parameters appear and host callbacks are called by plugin.
 *
 *  = Parameter types =
 *   - float, with range
 *   - 32-bit 2's complement signed int, with range
 *   - midi note, value stored as byte, with range
 *   - string
 *   - filename
 *   - boolean, value stored as byte, non-zero means TRUE, zero means FALSE 
 */

/* Notes:
 * - size_t is the ANSI C type used for memory sizes, as used in
 *   malloc()
 * - if function fails, variables where output parameters are normally
 *   stored remain unmodified.
 * - If host callback, called by plugin, fails - plugin should try the
 *   operation later.
